                        <p>Ion Creangă was a Moldavian, later Romanian writer, raconteur and schoolteacher. A
                            <strong>main figure
                                in 19th-century Romanian literature</strong>, he is best known for his Childhood
                            Memories volume, his
                            novellas and short stories, and his many anecdotes.</p> Creangă's <strong>main contribution
                            to fantasy and
                            children's literature</strong> includes narratives structured around eponymous protagonists
                        ("Harap Alb",
                        "Ivan Turbincă", "Dănilă Prepeleac", "Stan Pățitul"), as well as fairy tales indebted to
                        conventional forms ("The Story of the Pig", "The Goat and Her Three Kids", "The Mother with
                        Three Daughters-in-Law", "The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter").</p> Widely seen
                        as
                        <strong>masterpieces of the Romanian language</strong> and local humor, his writings occupy the
                        middle ground
                        between a collection of folkloric sources and an original contribution to a literary realism of
                        rural inspiration. They are accompanied by a set of contributions to erotic literature,
                        collectively known as his "corrosives".

                            <p><strong>Ion Creangă was born</strong> in Humulești in the Principality of Moldavia, a
                                former village which
                                has since been incorporated into Târgu Neamț city, the son of Orthodox trader Ștefan sin
                                Petre Ciubotariul and his wife Smaranda. His native area, bordering on heavily forested
                                areas, was in the Eastern Carpathian foothills, and included into what was then the
                                Principality of Moldavia.</p> The surrounding region's population preserved an archaic
                            way of life, dominated by shepherding, textile manufacturing and related occupations, and
                            noted for preserving the older forms of local folklore. Another characteristic of the area,
                            which left an impression on Creangă's family history, was related to the practice of
                            transhumance and <strong>the links between ethnic Romanian communities on both sides of the
                                mountains, in Moldavia and Transylvania</strong>: on his maternal side, the writer
                            descended from
                            Maramureș-born peasants, while, according to literary historian George Călinescu, his
                            father's origin may have been further southwest, in Transylvania-proper.

                            <p>In 1860, Creangă enlisted at the Faculty of Theology, part of the newly founded
                                University of Iași, and, in December 1860, fathered a son, Constantin. <strong>His life
                                    still
                                    lacked in stability</strong>, and he decided to move out of Grigoriu's supervision
                                and into
                                Bărboi Church, before his position as deacon was cut out of the budget and his
                                belongings were evicted out of his temporary lodging in 1864. He contemplated leaving
                                the city, and even officially requested a new assignment in the more remote Bolgrad.</p>
                            Since January 1864, when the Faculty of Theology had been closed down, he had been attending
                            Iași's Trei Ierarhi Monastery normal school (Trisfetite or Trei Sfetite), where he first met
                            the young cultural figure Titu Maiorescu, who served as his teacher and supervisor, and
                            whence he graduated as the first in his class (June 1865). Embittered by his own experience
                            with the education system, <strong>Creangă became an enthusiastic promoter of Maiorescu's
                                ideas on
                                education reform and modernization</strong>, and in particular of the new methods of
                            teaching reading
                            and writing.
