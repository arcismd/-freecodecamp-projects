                        <p>Ion Creangă was a Moldavian, later Romanian writer, raconteur and schoolteacher. A
                            <strong>main figure
                                in 19th-century Romanian literature</strong>, he is best known for his Childhood
                            Memories volume, his
                            novellas and short stories, and his many anecdotes.</p> Creangă's <strong>main contribution
                            to fantasy and
                            children's literature</strong> includes narratives structured around eponymous protagonists
                        ("Harap Alb",
                        "Ivan Turbincă", "Dănilă Prepeleac", "Stan Pățitul"), as well as fairy tales indebted to
                        conventional forms ("The Story of the Pig", "The Goat and Her Three Kids", "The Mother with
                        Three Daughters-in-Law", "The Old Man's Daughter and the Old Woman's Daughter").</p> Widely seen
                        as
                        <strong>masterpieces of the Romanian language</strong> and local humor, his writings occupy the
                        middle ground
                        between a collection of folkloric sources and an original contribution to a literary realism of
                        rural inspiration. They are accompanied by a set of contributions to erotic literature,
                        collectively known as his "corrosives".
